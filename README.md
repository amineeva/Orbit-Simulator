# Orbit Simulator
Project start: 3/23/2025
Project end: Ongoing

Creating this project to test out of SoftDes, SP 2025. Following requirements for the SoftDes 2024 midterm, here are my project goals:
- code to obtain or generate data and write it to one or more files
- code to read, process, summarize data. at least two .py files
- some form of interactivity 
- at least 3 different visualizations of data 
- avoid hard-coding pathways so others can use code easily 

This project is meant to be a mole-tracker. I'm hoping to be able to use it personally because I would like to track my moles for signs of irregularity/rapid growth. 

Update 3/30/25: Nevermind, we are making an orbit simulator because I already have MatLab code I can work off of. I also don't have to rely on learning new packages with this because I'm planning on keeping the actual math simple.
